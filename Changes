- if in the automated evasion test the initial simple request to eicar.txt
  results in the expected failure add the error message to the results sent
  in /submit_results
- track different request headers, i.e order of fields etc to distinguish browsers 
  and changes done by proxies
- by default garble URLs so firewalls can not simply block all URLs with 
  eicar.txt inside, switch off with --no-garble-url. It will still accept
  ungarbled URLs but produce garbled ones.
- with http://host/broken/ALL/testid etc one will get the test line with
  image, script, html ... for only this test (i.e http://host/broken/ALL/302).
